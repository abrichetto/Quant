Advanced algorithmic trading system with multi-perspective signal generation and portfolio management.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”¹ Evidence-Based Portfolio Manager Consensus

**Problem**: Most trading algorithms either follow rigid rules that can't adapt to changing markets or use black-box AI that provides no reasoning for decisions.

**Our Solution**: AlgoTrader Pro simulates how legendary investors would evaluate opportunities when presented with strong evidence, ensuring all investment theses are scrutinized from multiple perspectives:

- **Innovation Perspective** (Cathie Wood): Identifies disruptive technology and network effects
- **Digital Asset Perspective** (Michael Saylor): Evaluates cryptocurrency fundamentals and monetary theory
- **Institutional Perspective** (Jamie Dimon): Assesses regulatory environment and institutional adoption
- **Value Perspective** (Warren Buffett): Demands strong fundamentals and margin of safety

**What Makes This Special**: Unlike systems that simply mimic investor biases, our framework recognizes that *even the most skeptical investors approve unconventional investments when presented with compelling evidence*. This allows AlgoTrader Pro to:

- Generate well-reasoned investment theses that can be understood and evaluated
- Identify opportunities that would be missed by single-perspective systems
- Filter out weak signals that don't stand up to multi-perspective scrutiny
- Provide transparent reasoning that builds investor confidence
