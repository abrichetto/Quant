# News Intelligence System Architecture

## System Overview

The News Intelligence System is a hierarchical agent-based architecture designed to efficiently process large volumes of financial news and market information while filtering out noise and prioritizing actionable intelligence. The system consists of specialized feed agents supervised by a central intelligence director.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Hierarchical Processing** - Multi-tier processing enables efficient noise reduction and focused analysis
2. **Domain Specialization** - Dedicated agents for different market domains (crypto, equities, macro, etc.)
3. **Pattern Recognition Across Domains** - Correlation detection for cross-feed intelligence
4. **Signal Confidence Scoring** - Quantitative measurement of signal reliability
5. **Adaptive Noise Filtering** - Configurable noise cancellation thresholds

## System Architecture

### 1. News Intelligence Director (Meta-Supervisor)

The Director agent serves as the "brain" of the system, coordinating across all specialized feeds and detecting cross-domain patterns. Key responsibilities:

- Correlate signals across different domains
- Detect significant cross-domain patterns
- Generate high-level market intelligence
- Prioritize and escalate critical signals
- Provide comprehensive reporting

### 2. Specialized Feed Agents

Each feed agent focuses on a specific domain, bringing specialized knowledge and filtering capabilities:

#### WallStreet Feed
- Focuses on: Equities, analyst ratings, market movements
- Key intelligence: Analyst reports, upgrades/downgrades, institutional activity

#### Crypto Feed
- Focuses on: Cryptocurrency markets, blockchain technology, DeFi
- Key intelligence: Protocol updates, regulatory news, exchange developments

#### Macro Feed
- Focuses on: Macroeconomic indicators, central bank activity
- Key intelligence: Fed announcements, economic indicators, inflation data

#### International Feed
- Focuses on: Global markets and geopolitical developments
- Key intelligence: Geopolitical events, currency movements, trade disputes

#### Tech Feed
- Focuses on: Technology sector news and developments
- Key intelligence: Product launches, earnings, regulation, innovation

#### Regulatory Feed
- Focuses on: Financial regulation and legal developments
- Key intelligence: SEC announcements, CFTC news, congressional hearings

#### Earnings Feed
- Focuses on: Corporate earnings announcements and guidance
- Key intelligence: Earnings surprises, guidance changes, analyst reactions

#### Social Sentiment Feed
- Focuses on: Social media and retail sentiment
- Key intelligence: Reddit trends, Twitter sentiment, unusual activity

## Information Flow

1. Feed agents collect domain-specific data from various sources
2. Each feed applies domain-specific noise filtering
3. Feeds identify significant patterns and generate signals
4. The Director correlates signals across feeds
5. Cross-domain patterns trigger alerts with confidence scores
6. High-confidence/critical signals bypass standard processing

## Signal Prioritization

Signals are prioritized based on:

1. **Confidence Score** - Determined by source reliability, consensus, and pattern strength
2. **Signal Strength** - Magnitude of the detected pattern or anomaly
3. **Cross-Domain Correlation** - Number of different domains confirming the signal
4. **Time Sensitivity** - How quickly action must be taken
5. **Market Impact** - Potential effect on target assets

## Implementation Details

### Signal Types
- **Standard Signal** - Normal priority, processed in regular intervals
- **Immediate Signal** - High priority, processed as soon as received
- **Critical Signal** - Highest priority, bypasses normal processing

### Correlation Detection
- **Entity-Based** - Correlations around specific assets/companies
- **Topic-Based** - Correlations around market themes/topics
- **Temporal** - Correlations based on timing of events

### Noise Filtering Techniques
- Source credibility weighting
- Sentiment magnitude thresholds
- Relevance scoring
- Duplicate/near-duplicate detection
- Topic relevance filtering

## Performance Metrics

The system's effectiveness is measured through:

1. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio** - Quality of signals after filtering
2. **Predictive Accuracy** - How often signals correctly predict market movements
3. **Processing Efficiency** - Time from event detection to signal generation
4. **Coverage Completeness** - Percentage of significant market events captured
5. **False Positive Rate** - Frequency of incorrect signals

## Research Applications

The architecture supports:
- Backtesting signal effectiveness against historical price movements
- Creating multi-factor models incorporating news sentiment
- Developing specialized strategies for news-sensitive assets
- Detecting market regime changes through sentiment shifts
