# News Intelligence System Architecture

## Overview

AlgoTrader Pro's News Intelligence System is a hierarchical architecture designed to efficiently collect, process, and extract actionable trading signals from news and market sentiment. The system employs specialized feed agents to gather domain-specific intelligence, which is then aggregated and prioritized by a supervisory director agent.

## Architecture Components

### 1. News Intelligence Director

The director agent serves as the supervisory intelligence analyzer that:
- Registers and coordinates all feed agents
- Prioritizes incoming intelligence based on sentiment impact and relevance
- Maintains a repository of recent high-priority intelligence
- Identifies emerging trends and market themes
- Generates comprehensive intelligence reports and trading signals
- Calculates market-wide sentiment and sector impacts

### 2. Specialized Feed Agents

#### WallStreet Feed
- Focuses on equities markets, earnings reports, IPOs, and institutional activity
- Primary topics: equities, markets, earnings, dividends, mergers, acquisitions
- Optimal for traditional stock market signals

#### Crypto Feed
- Specializes in cryptocurrency markets, blockchain technologies, and digital assets
- Primary topics: bitcoin, ethereum, defi, nft, blockchain, mining, regulations
- Enhanced monitoring for BTC, ETH, AVAX, ADA, MATIC, SUI, DOGE, HBAR, ONE, UNI, SOL

#### Macro Feed
- Focuses on broad economic indicators, central bank actions, and policy changes
- Primary topics: economy, interest_rates, inflation, gdp, employment, fed, central_banks
- Critical for anticipating major market regime changes

#### International Feed
- Monitors global markets, geopolitical events, and cross-border economic impacts
- Primary topics: global_markets, geopolitical, forex, trade_war, sanctions, global_economy
- Essential for assessing external risks and opportunities

#### Tech Feed
- Focuses on technology sector news, innovations, and tech company developments
- Primary topics: technology, ai, cloud, cybersecurity, semiconductors, fintech
- Important for tracking innovation trends and disruption signals

## Intelligence Flow

1. **Collection**: Feed agents independently gather news from their specialized domains
2. **Processing**: Each feed performs initial filtering and formatting
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: The director processes sentiment scoring for all intelligence
4. **Prioritization**: Intelligence is ranked based on sentiment impact and relevance
5. **Trend Identification**: The director identifies emerging trends and themes
6. **Signal Generation**: Trading signals are generated from high-confidence intelligence
7. **Report Production**: Comprehensive reports are created for human analysis

## Noise Reduction Methodology

The system employs multiple layers of noise filtering:

1. **Domain Specialization**: Each feed only collects relevant domain-specific news
2. **Sentiment Impact Threshold**: Only intelligence with significant sentiment impact passes to high priority
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Intelligence is weighted by its relevance to tracked assets
4. **Trend Confirmation**: Signals require multiple confirming data points
5. **Confidence Minimums**: Low-confidence intelligence is excluded from reports
6. **Supervisory Oversight**: The director provides a final layer of filtering

## Integration Points

- **Research Repository**: All intelligence is stored in the structured research repository
- **Signal Generation**: Refined signals feed into the trading signals pipeline
- **Due Diligence Reports**: Intelligence is incorporated into asset research reports
- **Market Outlook**: Provides context for strategy adjustment and risk management

## Performance Metrics

The News Intelligence System is evaluated on:

1. Signal-to-noise ratio (measured by action-to-alert ratio)
2. Predictive accuracy of sentiment signals
3. Latency between news publication and signal generation
4. Trend identification accuracy
5. False positive rate for high priority intelligence
