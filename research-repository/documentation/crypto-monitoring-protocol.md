### Decision Process Example

For BTC/ETH evaluation:

1. **Raw Signal Generation**: Technical indicators and sentiment analysis produce initial signalevaluations);ily signals report generation (02:00 UTC)
2. **Multiple Perspective Review**: All four managers independently evaluate the signal    
3. **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Each manager articulates specific supporting reasoning discussion in the repository**Intraday Operations**:
4. **Weighted Consensus**: Evaluations are combined with appropriate expertise weightsl, evaluations, consensus);ourly market data updates
5. **Final Signal Generation**: Refined signal incorporates all perspectives and reasoning
